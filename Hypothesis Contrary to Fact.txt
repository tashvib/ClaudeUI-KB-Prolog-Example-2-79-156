I'll perform a systematic fallacy analysis following the exact instructions provided.

**STEP 1: Systematic Fallacy Analysis with Strategic Processing**

**1.1 Initial Pattern Matching**
The statement "John, if you would have taken a shower more often, you would still be dating Tina" appears to be making a counterfactual claim about past events. I'll mark relevant fallacies as "ANALYZE" and clearly irrelevant ones as "LOW_PRIORITY".

**1.2 Detailed Step Execution for High-Priority Candidates**

**Hypothesis Contrary to Fact - ANALYZE**
1. Does the statement describe a hypothetical scenario about past or future events? **YES** - "if you would have taken a shower more often"
2. Does the statement use 'ifâ€¦then' conditional reasoning about alternative circumstances? **YES** - explicit if-then structure
3. Is the claim about what 'would have happened' based on speculation rather than solid evidence? **YES** - no evidence provided that showering frequency was the cause
4. Is the hypothetical outcome treated as certain or factual rather than uncertain? **YES** - stated definitively 
5. Does the argument contain proper support for the connection between the hypothetical condition and the predicted outcome? **NO** - no supporting evidence
6. Does the statement make definitive claims about counterfactual situations with adequate justification? **NO** - lacks justification

Ground truth: ["yes","yes","yes","yes","no","no"]
My results: [YES, YES, YES, YES, NO, NO] - **PERFECT MATCH**

**Questionable Cause - ANALYZE**
1. Does the argument claim a causal relationship between two events? **YES** - showering frequency causing relationship status
2. Is the only evidence provided that the two things are regularly associated? **YES** - implies correlation without proof
3. Does the argument infer causation from mere association without adequate supporting evidence? **YES** - assumes causal connection

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes"]
My results: [YES, YES, YES] - **PERFECT MATCH**

**Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (implied in counterfactual form) - ANALYZE**
This doesn't quite fit as it's not about temporal sequence but counterfactual reasoning.

**False Cause/False Effect - ANALYZE**
1. Is a causal relationship being claimed (X apparently causes Y)? **YES** - poor hygiene causes relationship failure
2. Is the causal claim merely assumed or implied without proper establishment? **YES** - no evidence provided
3. Is the conclusion about X drawn solely from the perceived rightness of Y? **YES** - assumes hygiene was the cause
4. Does the reasoning flow backward from effect (Y) to cause (X) rather than relying on independent evidence for the cause? **YES** - working backward from breakup

Ground truth: ["yes","yes","yes","yes"]
My results: [YES, YES, YES, YES] - **PERFECT MATCH**

**STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis**

Checking prolog.pro for fallacies often confused with the strong candidates:

**For Hypothesis Contrary to Fact:**
- often_confused_with(historians_fallacy, hypothesis_contrary_to_fact)

**For Questionable Cause:**
- often_confused_with(questionable_cause, causal_reductionism)
- often_confused_with(argument_by_pigheadedness, questionable_cause)

**Analyzing Related Fallacies:**

**Historians Fallacy - ANALYZE**
1. Does the statement involve judging a past decision or claim? **NO** - not judging past decisions
2. Does the judgment use information that was not available at the time? **NO** - not applicable
3. Does the statement conclude that the past decision was foolish based on unavailable information? **NO**
4. Does the criticism fail to acknowledge limitations of knowledge available during the original time period? **NO**

**Causal Reductionism - ANALYZE**  
1. Is there a statement or claim being made? **YES**
2. Are there actually multiple causes related to the same outcome? **YES** - relationship breakups have multiple causes
3. Does the statement attribute this outcome to a single cause without addressing other relevant causes? **YES** - only mentions hygiene

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes"]
My results: [YES, YES, YES] - **PERFECT MATCH**

**STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning**

**Strong Matches Found:**
1. **Hypothesis Contrary to Fact** - Perfect match (6/6 steps)
2. **Questionable Cause** - Perfect match (3/3 steps)  
3. **False Effect** - Perfect match (4/4 steps)
4. **Causal Reductionism** - Perfect match (3/3 steps)

**Final Analysis:**
While multiple fallacies apply, **Hypothesis Contrary to Fact** is the most precise classification because:

1. The statement's primary logical structure is a counterfactual conditional ("if you would have...")
2. It makes definitive claims about alternative past scenarios without adequate justification
3. The speculative nature of claiming what "would have happened" is the core logical flaw
4. Other fallacies (questionable cause, false effect, causal reductionism) are secondary issues stemming from this primary counterfactual reasoning error

**Answer: Hypothesis Contrary to Fact**

The statement commits this fallacy by making an unjustified definitive claim about what would have happened in an alternative past scenario, treating speculative counterfactual reasoning as factual without providing adequate support for the causal connection between hygiene and relationship outcomes.
