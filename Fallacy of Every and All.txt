I'll perform a comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps specified.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze this statement systematically through the fallacy instruction sets in final_instructions.json.

**Statement Analysis:**
- Premise 1: "Everyone loves someone"
- Premise 2: "I am someone" 
- Conclusion: "Therefore, everyone loves me!"

This appears to involve quantifier logic, so let me focus on relevant fallacies:

### Quantifier Shift Fallacy Analysis:
1. **Does the statement contain two quantifiers (universal and existential)?** YES - "Everyone" (universal) and "someone" (existential)
2. **Does the original statement have the form 'Every X has a related Y'?** YES - "Everyone loves someone" = "Every person loves some person"
3. **Does the conclusion claim 'There is some Y related to every X'?** YES - The conclusion claims "everyone loves me" which means "there is some person (me) loved by every person"
4. **Is the order of quantifiers reversed between premise and conclusion?** YES - From ∀x∃y to ∃y∀x
5. **Does the reversal change the logical meaning inappropriately?** YES - Completely changes meaning
6. **Does this reversal lead to an invalid inference?** YES

**Ground Truth Match:** [yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes] - PERFECT MATCH

### Fallacy of Every and All Analysis:
1. **Does the statement contain universal quantifiers (all, every, none) and existential qualifiers (some, few, many)?** YES - "everyone" and "someone"
2. **Is a claim made with quantifiers in a specific order?** YES - "Everyone loves someone"
3. **Does the conclusion reverse the order of the quantifiers?** YES - From "everyone loves someone" to "everyone loves me"
4. **Does the reversed order change the logical meaning?** YES
5. **Is a single quantifier term used equivocally with different meanings?** YES - "someone" shifts from indefinite to specific ("me")

**Ground Truth Match:** [yes, yes, yes, yes, yes] - PERFECT MATCH

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

Searching prolog.txt for related fallacies:

**Quantifier Shift Fallacy is often confused with:**
- fallacy_of_composition
- existential_fallacy

**Fallacy of Every and All is often confused with:**
- fallacy_of_four_terms
- begging_the_question

Let me analyze these related fallacies:

### Fallacy of Composition Analysis:
1. **Is a part-to-whole relationship being discussed?** NO - This is about quantifier relationships, not parts/wholes
2. **Is a property attributed to a part/component?** NO
3. **Does the conclusion claim the whole possesses the same property?** NO
4. **Does the property necessarily transfer from part to whole?** N/A
5. **Is there additional valid reasoning?** NO

**Ground Truth Match:** [yes, yes, yes, no, no] - Does NOT match (fails on first three steps)

### Existential Fallacy Analysis:
1. **Is this a categorical syllogism with two premises and one conclusion?** NO - This involves quantifier logic, not categorical syllogisms
2. **Do both premises use universal qualifiers?** NO - "I am someone" is not universal
3. **Does the conclusion use qualifiers like 'some', 'there are'?** NO
4. **Does it assume existence from universals?** NO

**Ground Truth Match:** [yes, yes, yes, yes] - Does NOT match

### Fallacy of Four Terms Analysis:
1. **Is the argument structured similarly to a categorical syllogism?** SOMEWHAT - but this is quantifier logic
2. **Are there more than 3 terms present?** NO - "everyone," "someone," "me" (3 terms, but "someone" shifts meaning)
3. **Does the middle term correctly connect other terms?** NO - "someone" shifts meaning

**Ground Truth Match:** [yes, yes, no] - Partial match but weaker than primary candidates

### Begging the Question Analysis:
1. **Is a person making a claim or argument?** YES
2. **Does the argument's validity depend on already accepting what it's trying to prove?** NO - The error is logical, not circular
3. **Does the claim use circular reasoning?** NO

**Ground Truth Match:** [yes, yes, yes] - Does NOT match

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

**Comparison of Results:**

1. **Quantifier Shift Fallacy:** Perfect match (6/6) with ground truths
2. **Fallacy of Every and All:** Perfect match (5/5) with ground truths  
3. **All other fallacies:** Partial or no matches

**Logical Analysis:**
The statement commits a classic quantifier scope error:
- Original: ∀x∃y(Loves(x,y)) - "For every person, there exists someone they love"
- Invalid conclusion: ∃y∀x(Loves(x,y)) - "There exists someone whom everyone loves"

This is the textbook definition of a Quantifier Shift Fallacy.

**Final Selection: Quantifier Shift Fallacy**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Perfect Ground Truth Match:** The statement matches all 6 criteria for Quantifier Shift Fallacy
2. **Classic Example:** This represents the canonical form of quantifier scope error
3. **Logical Precision:** The error is specifically about the improper reversal of quantifier order (∀∃ → ∃∀)
4. **Clear Distinction:** While "Fallacy of Every and All" also matches perfectly, "Quantifier Shift Fallacy" is the more precise technical term for this specific logical error in formal logic
5. **Strongest Logical Foundation:** The analysis clearly identifies the invalid inference from "everyone loves someone" to "everyone loves me" as a quantifier scope fallacy

The statement "Everyone loves someone. I am someone. Therefore, everyone loves me!" is a **Quantifier Shift Fallacy**.
