I'll perform a comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps outlined.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze this statement against the fallacies in the JSON file. The statement follows a logical structure:
- If P (have cable), then Q (seen a naked lady)
- Not P (don't have cable)
- Therefore, not Q (never seen a naked lady)

This appears to match the pattern of **Denying the Antecedent**. Let me execute the step-by-step analysis:

### Denying the Antecedent Analysis:
1. "Identify if there is a conditional statement. For example if P then Q." → **YES** (If I have cable, then I have seen a naked lady)
2. "Identify if the antecedent, P, is confirmed as being true." → **NO** (The antecedent is denied: "I don't have cable")
3. "Identify if a conclusion is made about the truth of Q using the truth value of P." → **YES** (Concludes "never seen a naked lady" based on not having cable)

**Ground truth comparison**: [yes, no, yes] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

From the Prolog file, I found that "Denying the Antecedent" is often confused with:
- `negating_antecedent_and_consequent`
- `magical_thinking`

Let me analyze these related fallacies:

### Negating Antecedent and Consequent Analysis:
1. "Does the argument contain a conditional statement of the form 'If P then Q'?" → **YES**
2. "Does the conclusion derive directly from that conditional premise?" → **YES**
3. "Does the conclusion negate both the antecedent (P) and the consequent (Q)?" → **YES** (not P and not Q)
4. "Are the negated terms left in their original positions?" → **YES**

**Ground truth comparison**: [yes, yes, yes, yes] - **PERFECT MATCH**

### Magical Thinking Analysis:
1. "Does the statement claim a causal connection or correlation between two events?" → **YES** (cable → seeing naked lady)
2. "Is the connection based on logic or evidence" → **NO** (no logical connection between having cable and seeing naked ladies)
3. "Is the connection based on superstition or magic?" → **YES** (arbitrary causal assumption)
4. "Is the claimed relationship supported by factual or logical foundation?" → **NO**

**Ground truth comparison**: [yes, no, yes, no] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

I have three fallacies with perfect matches to their ground truths:
1. **Denying the Antecedent**
2. **Negating Antecedent and Consequent**  
3. **Magical Thinking**

**Final Selection: Denying the Antecedent**

**Comprehensive Reasoning:**

While all three fallacies technically match their ground truths, **Denying the Antecedent** is the most precise classification because:

1. **Primary Logical Structure**: The statement's core error is the invalid inference from "If P then Q" and "not P" to "not Q" - this is the textbook definition of denying the antecedent.

2. **Specificity**: Denying the Antecedent is more specific to this exact logical form, while the other fallacies are broader categories that could encompass many different types of errors.

3. **Classical Logic Focus**: This is a well-established formal logical fallacy that directly addresses the invalid conditional reasoning pattern present in the statement.

4. **Precedence**: In logical analysis, when multiple fallacies apply, the most specific and direct logical error takes precedence.

The statement commits the fallacy of **Denying the Antecedent** by incorrectly concluding that because the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the consequent must also be false.
