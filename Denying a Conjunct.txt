I'll perform the comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps specified.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze this statement against all fallacies in the JSON file. The statement follows this logical structure:
- Premise 1: I am not both a Christian and a Satanist
- Premise 2: I am not a Satanist  
- Conclusion: Therefore, I am a Christian

After systematically checking each fallacy's steps against the ground truths, I found one perfect match:

**Denying a Conjunct**
- Step 1: "Does the argument claim that both Condition P and Condition Q cannot be true at the same time?" → YES (cannot be both Christian and Satanist)
- Step 2: "Does the argument claim that one of Condition P or Condition Q does not hold?" → YES (claims not a Satanist)
- Step 3: "Does the argument conclude that the other condition (Q or P) must be true?" → YES (concludes must be Christian)
- Step 4: "Is the conclusion supported by additional evidence?" → NO (no additional evidence provided)

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "no"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

Searching the Prolog file for fallacies often confused with "Denying a Conjunct":
- No explicit relationships found for "denying_a_conjunct" in the often_confused_with predicates

However, I also checked related logical fallacies and found another relevant match:

**Affirming a Disjunct** - This is logically related as it deals with similar disjunctive reasoning errors:
- Step 1: "Is there a disjunctive statement (P or Q) presented?" → YES (implicit "Christian or not Christian")
- Step 2: "Is one of the disjuncts affirmed as true?" → YES (affirms "not Satanist")
- Step 3: "Is the other disjunct claimed as false?" → YES (claims "not Christian" is false)
- Step 4: "Is the second disjunct claimed as false solely because the first disjunct was claimed as true?" → YES
- Step 5: "Is the 'or' defined as exclusive?" → NO (not explicitly defined)
- Step 6: "Does it follow this logical structure: 'P or Q, P/Q is true, therefore not Q/not P'?" → YES

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "no", "yes"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

Both fallacies match perfectly with their ground truths, but I must select the best fit:

**Selected Fallacy: Denying a Conjunct**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Structural Match**: The argument explicitly states "I am not both a Christian and a Satanist" - this is a direct negation of a conjunction, which is the core focus of the Denying a Conjunct fallacy.

2. **Logical Form**: The argument follows the exact pattern of Denying a Conjunct:
   - ¬(P ∧ Q) [not both Christian and Satanist]
   - ¬Q [not a Satanist]
   - Therefore P [therefore Christian]

3. **Fallacy Explanation**: This is invalid reasoning because from "not both P and Q" and "not Q," we cannot conclude "P." The person could be neither Christian nor Satanist, making both disjuncts false while still satisfying the original constraint.

4. **Precision**: While Affirming a Disjunct also matches, it requires interpreting the implicit disjunctive structure, whereas Denying a Conjunct directly addresses the explicit conjunctive negation presented in the statement.

The statement commits the **Denying a Conjunct** fallacy by incorrectly inferring that if one cannot be both Christian and Satanist, and one is not a Satanist, then one must be a Christian - ignoring the possibility of being neither.
