I'll analyze this statement following the exact procedure you've outlined.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me systematically go through the fallacies in the JSON file to find potential matches.

After analyzing the statement, I notice Chuck is misinterpreting Steve's use of "fantastic" by focusing on its literal etymological meaning ("existing in imagination/fantasy") rather than its common contemporary meaning ("wonderful/great"). This suggests **Etymological Fallacy**.

Let me verify this analysis:

**Etymological Fallacy Analysis:**
- Step 1: "Is there a word with different modern and historical meanings mentioned?" → YES (fantastic)
- Step 2: "Are both modern and historic meanings referenced?" → YES (Steve uses modern meaning "wonderful", Chuck references historical meaning "imaginary")  
- Step 3: "Is the historical meaning seen as the true meaning?" → YES (Chuck treats the etymological meaning as definitive)

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

From the Prolog file, I find these fallacies often confused with Etymological Fallacy:
- Appeal to Definition
- Equivocation

Let me analyze each:

**Appeal to Definition:**
- Step 1: "Is a dictionary definition being used as primary evidence?" → NO (Chuck uses etymological origin, not dictionary)
- Step 2: "Does argument claim term cannot have meanings beyond dictionary?" → NO
- Step 3: "Does argument dismiss expanded meanings?" → PARTIALLY
- Step 4: "Is contextual meaning rejected for dictionary definition?" → NO

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes"] - **POOR MATCH** (1/4 clear matches)

**Equivocation:**
- Step 1: "Do key terms appear multiple times?" → YES (fantastic appears twice)
- Step 2: "Are multiple meanings used?" → YES (wonderful vs. imaginary)
- Step 3: "Does statement rely on purposeful misinterpretation?" → UNCLEAR (could be genuine confusion vs. deliberate)

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes"] - **PARTIAL MATCH** (2/3 clear matches, 1 uncertain)

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

**Comparative Analysis:**

1. **Etymological Fallacy**: Perfect 3/3 match with ground truths
2. **Appeal to Definition**: Poor 1/4 match 
3. **Equivocation**: Partial 2/3 match with uncertainty

**Key Distinguishing Factors:**

- Chuck specifically invokes the historical/etymological meaning of "fantastic" ("existing in imagination")
- He treats this older meaning as the "true" definition ("That is what fantastic means, after all")
- This is the core characteristic of Etymological Fallacy: privileging historical word meanings over contemporary usage
- Unlike simple equivocation, Chuck isn't just switching between meanings - he's specifically asserting the etymological meaning as correct
- Unlike appeal to definition, he's not citing a dictionary but referencing word origins

**Final Selection: Etymological Fallacy**

Chuck commits the Etymological Fallacy by rejecting Steve's contemporary use of "fantastic" (meaning wonderful) and insisting that the word's etymological meaning (relating to fantasy/imagination) is its "true" meaning. This demonstrates the classic pattern of this fallacy: treating a word's historical or root meaning as more valid than its current accepted usage, despite natural language evolution.
