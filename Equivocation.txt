I'll perform a comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps specified.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze the statement: "The priest told me I should have faith. I have faith that my son will do well in school this year. Therefore, the priest should be happy with me."

I'll systematically check this against each fallacy in the JSON file. After analyzing all fallacies, the strongest matches are:

**Equivocation** - Strong match:
- Step 1: "faith" appears multiple times ✓
- Step 2: Multiple meanings used - religious faith vs. confidence/hope ✓  
- Step 3: Purposeful misinterpretation to mislead ✓
- Ground truth match: [yes, yes, yes] ✓

**Use Mention Error** - Strong match:
- All 6 steps align with ground truth [yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes]
- The word "faith" is confused between its religious meaning and secular meaning

**Weak Analogy** - Partial match:
- Steps 1-4 match, but steps 5-6 are debatable
- The analogy between religious and secular faith has significant differences

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

From prolog.txt, I found these fallacies often confused with **Equivocation**:
- accident_fallacy
- etymological_fallacy  
- appeal_to_nature
- use_mention_error

I analyzed each related fallacy:

**Etymological Fallacy**: No match - no historical vs. modern meanings discussed
**Accident Fallacy**: No match - no general rule being applied universally
**Appeal to Nature**: No match - no natural vs. unnatural value judgments
**Use Mention Error**: Strong match - confirmed from Step 1

For **Use Mention Error**, the related fallacies are:
- reification
- equivocation

**Reification**: No match - no abstract concepts treated as physical entities

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

**Selected Fallacy: Equivocation**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Perfect Ground Truth Match**: Equivocation matches all ground truth criteria [yes, yes, yes] with 100% accuracy.

2. **Clear Semantic Shift**: The argument exploits two distinct meanings of "faith":
   - Religious/spiritual faith (as intended by the priest)
   - Secular confidence/hope (about the son's academic performance)

3. **Logical Structure**: The argument's invalidity stems directly from this semantic shift. The priest's instruction about religious faith cannot be satisfied by expressing confidence about worldly matters.

4. **Intent to Mislead**: The speaker appears to deliberately conflate these meanings to create a false logical connection.

5. **Comparison with Alternatives**: While Use Mention Error also scored well, Equivocation more precisely captures the semantic manipulation that drives the argument's flaw. The issue isn't confusing a word with its referent, but rather exploiting multiple meanings of the same word.

**Conclusion**: This is a clear case of **Equivocation**, where the argument's apparent validity depends entirely on the ambiguous use of "faith" with two different meanings, creating a false logical bridge between unrelated concepts.
