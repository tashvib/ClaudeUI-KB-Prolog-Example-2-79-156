I'll perform a comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps specified.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze this statement against all fallacies in the JSON file systematically. The statement is:
"All Paul Newman movies are great. All great movies are Oscar winners. Therefore, all Oscar winners are Paul Newman movies."

This appears to be a categorical syllogism with a logical error. Let me check the most relevant fallacies:

**Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle Analysis:**
1. Is there a categorical syllogism with two premises and one conclusion? **YES**
2. Do both premises link different categories (A and B) to the same middle term (C), and the conclusion links A and B directly? **YES** - Paul Newman movies (A) and Oscar winners (B) are both linked to "great movies" (C), and the conclusion directly links A and B
3. Is there any additional valid reasoning or evidence (outside the premises) that justifies the conclusion? **NO**

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "no"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

**Affirming the Consequent Analysis:**
1. Is there a conditional statement (If P then Q)? **NO** - These are categorical statements with "all"
2. Is the consequent (Q) stated as true? **N/A**
3. Does the reasoning flow from Q being true to P being true? **N/A**

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes"] - **NO MATCH**

**Commutation of Conditionals Analysis:**
1. Is the statement being made? **YES**
2. Does the statement contain conditional relationships such as (if P then Q) format? **NO** - Uses "all" statements, not conditional
3. [Remaining steps N/A]

**NO MATCH**

After analyzing multiple fallacies, **Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle** shows a perfect match.

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

From the Prolog file, fallacies often confused with "Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle":
- circular_definition
- fallacy_of_four_terms  
- negative_conclusion_from_affirmative_premises
- illicit_major
- illicit_minor
- unwarranted_contrast

Let me analyze each:

**Fallacy of Four Terms:**
1. Is the argument structured similarly to a categorical syllogism? **YES**
2. Are there more than 3 terms present? **NO** - Only 3 terms: Paul Newman movies, great movies, Oscar winners
3. Does the middle term correctly connect the other terms for the syllogism? **NO** - The middle term "great movies" is not distributed properly

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "no"] - **NO MATCH** (we have exactly 3 terms, not more than 3)

**Illicit Major:**
1. Is the argument a categorical syllogism with major premise, minor premise, and conclusion? **YES**
2. Is the major term distributed in the conclusion? **YES** - "Oscar winners" is distributed (all Oscar winners)
3. Is the major term distributed in the major premise? **NO** - "Oscar winners" appears as predicate in "All great movies are Oscar winners"

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "no"] - **PARTIAL MATCH** but this focuses on distribution of major term specifically

**Illicit Minor:**
1. Is the argument a categorical syllogism? **YES**
2. Is the minor term distributed in the conclusion? **NO** - "Paul Newman movies" is not distributed in conclusion
3. [Not applicable]

**NO MATCH**

**Negative Conclusion from Affirmative Premises:**
1. Is the argument a categorical syllogism? **YES**
2. Are both premises positive statements? **YES**
3. Is the conclusion a negative statement? **NO** - Conclusion is positive

**NO MATCH**

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

**Selected Fallacy: Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle**

**Complete Reasoning:**

1. **Perfect Ground Truth Match**: The Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle analysis resulted in a perfect match with its ground truth pattern ["yes", "yes", "no"].

2. **Structural Analysis**: The argument follows the classic undistributed middle structure:
   - Premise 1: All A are C (All Paul Newman movies are great)
   - Premise 2: All C are B (All great movies are Oscar winners)  
   - Invalid Conclusion: All B are A (All Oscar winners are Paul Newman movies)

3. **The Critical Error**: The middle term "great movies" is never distributed in either premise. In Premise 1, it's the predicate of a universal affirmative. In Premise 2, it's the subject but refers to a subset. The conclusion illegitimately reverses the relationship.

4. **Why Other Fallacies Don't Fit**:
   - **Illicit Major/Minor**: While related, these focus on specific term distribution issues, whereas this is fundamentally about the undistributed middle term
   - **Fallacy of Four Terms**: We have exactly three terms, not four
   - **Conditional fallacies**: This uses categorical "all" statements, not conditional logic

5. **Logical Invalidity**: The argument commits the classic error of assuming that because two categories both relate to a third category, they must relate to each other in the reverse direction.

The **Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle** is the precise classification for this logical error.
