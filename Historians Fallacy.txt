I'll analyze this statement systematically following the exact methodology specified.

**STEP 1: Systematic Fallacy Analysis with Strategic Processing**

Let me first perform initial pattern matching to identify potentially relevant fallacies, then conduct detailed analysis.

**Initial Pattern Matching Assessment:**
The statement makes a causal claim about Judas being an "idiot" based on his subsequent suicide, suggesting a reasoning pattern that connects an outcome to a judgment about the original decision.

**Detailed Analysis of High-Priority Candidates:**

**Affirming the Consequent:**
- Step 1: Is there a conditional statement (If P then Q)? **No** - No explicit conditional structure
- This fallacy doesn't apply.

**Historians Fallacy:**
- Step 1: Does the statement involve judging a past decision? **Yes** - Judging Judas's decision
- Step 2: Does the judgment use information not available at the time? **Yes** - Uses knowledge of the suicide outcome
- Step 3: Does it conclude the decision was foolish based on unavailable information? **Yes** - Calls Judas "idiot" based on suicide
- Step 4: Does it fail to acknowledge knowledge limitations of the original time? **Yes** - No consideration of Judas's state of mind at the time
- **STRONG MATCH** with ground truth [yes, yes, yes, yes]

**Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (Questionable Cause):**
- Step 1: Does it claim a causal relationship between two events? **Yes** - Decision â†’ being an idiot (implied)
- Step 2: Is the only evidence that they're associated? **Yes** - Sequential relationship cited
- Step 3: Does it infer causation from mere association? **Yes** - Suicide used to prove "idiocy"
- **STRONG MATCH** with ground truth [yes, yes, yes]

**STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis**

From the Prolog file, I find that Historians Fallacy is often confused with:
- Hypothesis Contrary to Fact

**Hypothesis Contrary to Fact Analysis:**
- Step 1: Does it describe a hypothetical scenario about past/future events? **No** - Makes direct judgment, not hypothetical
- This doesn't apply.

**STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning**

**Primary Analysis Results:**
1. **Historians Fallacy**: Perfect match (4/4 steps) - judges past decision using information unavailable at the time
2. **Questionable Cause**: Strong match (3/3 steps) - infers causal relationship from sequential association

**Key Differentiation:**
While both fallacies apply, the **Historians Fallacy** is more precise because:
- The statement specifically judges a historical decision ("Judas was an idiot to turn Jesus over")
- It uses outcome knowledge (suicide) that wasn't available to Judas when making his original decision
- The logical error is fundamentally about temporal perspective and knowledge availability
- The "After all" construction explicitly uses the later outcome to justify the judgment about the earlier decision

The Questionable Cause element is present but secondary to the main logical error of judging past decisions with hindsight knowledge.

**CONCLUSION: Historians Fallacy**

The statement commits the Historians Fallacy by judging Judas's historical decision as foolish based on consequences (his suicide) that he couldn't have known about when making the original choice to turn Jesus over to authorities.
