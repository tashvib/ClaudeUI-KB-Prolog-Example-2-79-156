I'll analyze this statement following the exact steps specified. Let me work through this systematically.

**STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis**

Let me examine this statement against the fallacies in the JSON file. The statement is:
"All Greek gods are mythical. All modern day gods are real. Therefore, all Greek gods are real."

This appears to be a logical syllogism with a clear structural error. Let me check specific fallacies:

**Fallacy of Four Terms Analysis:**
- Step 1: "Is the argument structured similarly to a categorical syllogism?" → **YES**
- Step 2: "Are there more than 3 terms present?" → **YES** (Greek gods, mythical, modern day gods, real - 4 distinct terms)
- Step 3: "Does the middle term correctly connect the other terms for the syllogism?" → **NO** (there's no proper middle term connecting the premises to the conclusion)

Ground truth comparison: ["yes", "yes", "no"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

**STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis**

From the Prolog file, I find that Fallacy of Four Terms is often confused with:
- Non Sequitur
- Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle

Let me analyze these:

**Non Sequitur Analysis:**
- Step 1: "Does the argument contain a conclusion?" → **YES**
- Step 2: "Does the argument present specific premises, evidence, or reasoning?" → **YES** 
- Step 3: "Is the evidence or reason relevant to the conclusion?" → **NO** (the premises about mythical Greek gods and real modern gods don't support the conclusion that Greek gods are real)

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "no"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

**Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle Analysis:**
- Step 1: "Is there a categorical syllogism with two premises and one conclusion?" → **YES**
- Step 2: "Do both premises link different categories (A and B) to the same middle term (C), and the conclusion links A and B directly?" → **NO** (there's no shared middle term between the premises)
- Step 3: "Is there any additional valid reasoning or evidence that justifies the conclusion?" → **NO**

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "no"] - Does not match (my result: yes, no, no)

**STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning**

**Analysis Results:**
- **Fallacy of Four Terms**: Perfect match with ground truth
- **Non Sequitur**: Perfect match with ground truth  
- **Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle**: Does not match ground truth

**Final Selection: Fallacy of Four Terms**

**Comprehensive Reasoning:**

While both "Fallacy of Four Terms" and "Non Sequitur" match their ground truths perfectly, the **Fallacy of Four Terms** is the more precise identification because:

1. **Structural Specificity**: This fallacy specifically identifies syllogistic errors where more than three terms appear, preventing the formation of a valid categorical syllogism. The statement contains exactly four distinct terms: "Greek gods," "mythical," "modern day gods," and "real."

2. **Classical Logic Framework**: The statement attempts to follow syllogistic structure but fails due to the presence of four terms instead of the required three, which is the defining characteristic of this fallacy.

3. **Precision over Generality**: While "Non Sequitur" correctly identifies that the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises, "Fallacy of Four Terms" provides the specific logical reason WHY it doesn't follow - the structural impossibility of a valid syllogism with four terms.

4. **Traditional Logic Classification**: In formal logic education, this type of error is classically categorized as a "Fallacy of Four Terms" rather than the more general "Non Sequitur."

The statement commits the **Fallacy of Four Terms** because it attempts to construct a syllogism but uses four distinct terms instead of three, making it logically impossible to reach a valid conclusion regardless of the truth values of the individual premises.
