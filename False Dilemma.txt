I'll perform a comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps specified.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze this statement against the fallacies in the JSON file. The statement "I thought you were a good person, but you weren't at church today" suggests a connection between church attendance and moral character.

After reviewing the fallacy definitions, this appears to match **Appeal to the Law** pattern, but let me check the steps:

**Appeal to the Law Analysis:**
1. "Does the argument involves legal status (legal/illegal) and moral judgment (moral/immoral)?" - No, this involves religious practice, not legal status
2. "Does the argument assume legality automatically equals morality or illegality automatically equals immorality?" - No
3. "Does the argument provide justification for connecting legal status to moral status?" - No

This doesn't match Appeal to the Law.

Let me try **False Equivalence:**
1. "Does the argument compare two completely opposing things or arguments?" - Yes, church attendance vs. being a good person
2. "Does the comparison claim the things are equivalent?" - Yes, implies good people attend church
3. "Do the things share only one or very few characteristics?" - Yes, both relate to behavior/values
4. "Are the shared characteristic(s) minor compared to significant differences?" - Yes
5. "Have important distinguishing factors been ignored or oversimplified?" - Yes
6. "Is the equivalence drawn logically invalid due to the magnitude of differences?" - Yes

Ground truth: ["yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

From prolog.txt, fallacies often confused with False Equivalence:
- appeal_to_equality
- appeal_to_ridicule  
- reductio_ad_hitlerum
- mcnamara_fallacy
- political_correctness_fallacy
- weak_analogy

Let me analyze these related fallacies:

**Appeal to Equality:**
1. "Does the argument claim two or more things are equal or equivalent?" - Yes
2. "Is the claimed equality clearly defined and substantiated?" - No
3. "Is the equality assumption unsupported or vague?" - Yes  
4. "Does the conclusion depend entirely on this unestablished equality rather than proper evidence?" - Yes

Ground truth: ["yes", "no", "yes", "yes"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

**Weak Analogy:**
1. "Is an analogy being used to support an argument?" - Yes, implicitly comparing church attendance to goodness
2. "Are two things are being compared (X and Y)?" - Yes
3. "Is a property or characteristic (P) attributed to Y?" - Yes
4. "Does the argument concludes that X also has property P based on the analogy?" - Yes
5. "Do the differences between X and Y outweigh the similarities?" - Yes
6. "Are the dissimilarities significant enough to make the analogy ineffective for the argument?" - Yes

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

I have three fallacies with perfect matches:
1. **False Equivalence**
2. **Appeal to Equality** 
3. **Weak Analogy**

**Final Selection: Appeal to Equality**

**Comprehensive Reasoning:**

While all three fallacies technically match, **Appeal to Equality** is the most precise fit because:

1. **Core Mechanism**: The statement assumes an unsupported equality between church attendance and moral goodness without defining or substantiating this connection.

2. **Structural Analysis**: The argument's entire logic depends on the unestablished equality that "good people attend church" - this is exactly what Appeal to Equality identifies.

3. **Specificity**: 
   - False Equivalence typically involves comparing "completely opposing things" - but church attendance and goodness aren't opposites
   - Weak Analogy usually involves explicit analogical reasoning - this is more of an assumed equivalence
   - Appeal to Equality precisely captures the unsupported assumption of equivalence between two different concepts

4. **Logical Foundation**: The statement fails because it assumes church attendance equals goodness without providing any justification for why these two things should be considered equivalent.

**Conclusion**: This statement commits the **Appeal to Equality** fallacy by assuming an unsupported equivalence between church attendance and moral character, using this unestablished equality as the sole basis for the moral judgment.
