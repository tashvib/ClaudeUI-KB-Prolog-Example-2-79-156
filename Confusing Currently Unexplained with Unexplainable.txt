I'll perform a comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps specified.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze this statement against all fallacies in the JSON file systematically.

**Statement:** "While we may be able to explain how humans got here, we will never be able to explain why."

After analyzing all fallacies in the JSON file, I found several potential matches. Let me focus on the strongest candidates:

### Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable
- Step 1: "Does the statement mention something that is currently unexplained or unknown?" → **YES** (the "why" of human existence)
- Step 2: "Does the statement conclude that since there is no current explanation, it is unexplainable?" → **YES** ("we will never be able to explain why")
- Step 3: "Is a logical explanation given for why it would be unexplainable?" → **NO** (no reasoning provided for impossibility)

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "no"]
My results: ["yes", "yes", "no"] ✓ **PERFECT MATCH**

### Unfalsifiability
- Step 1: "Is a claim being asserted as definitively true or false?" → **YES** ("we will never be able")
- Step 2: "Can the claim be tested through observation or physical experiment?" → **NO** (claim about permanent impossibility)
- Step 3: "Does there exist any possible evidence that could approve or disprove the claim?" → **NO** (unfalsifiable assertion)
- Step 4: "Is the assertion made with confidence despite lack of testable evidence?" → **YES** (definitive "never")

Ground truth: ["yes", "no", "no", "yes"]
My results: ["yes", "no", "no", "yes"] ✓ **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

Searching the Prolog file for fallacies often confused with these candidates:

### Related to "Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable":
- often_confused_with(confusing_currently_unexplained_with_unexplainable, jumping_to_conclusions)
- often_confused_with(confusing_an_explanation_with_an_excuse, confusing_currently_unexplained_with_unexplainable)

### Related to "Unfalsifiability":
- often_confused_with(missing_data_fallacy, unfalsifiability)

Let me analyze these related fallacies:

### Jumping to Conclusions
- Step 1: "Does the statement present a conclusion?" → **YES**
- Step 2: "Is little or no supporting evidence provided?" → **YES**
- Step 3: "Does the argument proceed directly from limited evidence to conclusion?" → **YES**

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes"]
My results: ["yes", "yes", "yes"] ✓ **PERFECT MATCH**

### Missing Data Fallacy
- Step 1: "Is a hypothesis or conclusion being presented?" → **YES**
- Step 2: "Is a fatal flaw pointed out?" → **NO**
- Step 3: "Does the person refuse to acknowledge ignorance?" → **NO**
- Step 4: "Does the person claim missing data exists?" → **NO**
- Step 5: "Does the person assume missing data will validate their claim?" → **NO**

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes"]
My results: ["yes", "no", "no", "no", "no"] ✗ **Poor match**

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

**Analysis Summary:**
- **Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable**: Perfect match (3/3)
- **Unfalsifiability**: Perfect match (4/4)
- **Jumping to Conclusions**: Perfect match (3/3)
- **Missing Data Fallacy**: Poor match (1/5)

**Final Selection: Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable**

**Comprehensive Reasoning:**

While three fallacies achieved perfect matches, "Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable" is the most precise classification because:

1. **Core Logic Match**: The statement directly exemplifies the fallacy's central error - moving from "currently unexplained" (why humans exist) to "unexplainable" (never will be explained) without justification.

2. **Structural Precision**: The statement has the exact structure this fallacy addresses:
   - Acknowledges current explanatory success ("how humans got here")
   - Identifies an unexplained aspect ("why")
   - Makes an unjustified leap to permanent unexplainability ("never")

3. **Specificity**: While "Unfalsifiability" and "Jumping to Conclusions" also apply, they are more general. This fallacy specifically targets the logical error of conflating temporal limitation with permanent impossibility.

4. **Philosophical Context**: The statement deals with existential questions where this fallacy commonly occurs - assuming that current explanatory gaps represent permanent barriers to understanding.

**Answer: Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable**
