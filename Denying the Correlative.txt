I'll perform the comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps specified.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze this statement against all fallacies in the JSON file. The statement is:
**Judge: So did you kill your landlord or not? Kirk: I fought with him.**

After systematically checking each fallacy's steps against the ground truth patterns, I found one clear match:

**Avoiding the Issue**
- Step 1: "Is a person asking a question, making a claim, or arguing something?" → YES (Judge asks direct question)
- Step 2: "Does a second person directly address the statements from the first person?" → NO (Kirk doesn't answer the yes/no question)
- Step 3: "Does person 2 create an unrelated argument to divert attention?" → NO (Kirk mentions fighting, which is related but not the same)
- Step 4: "Does the original claim, statement, or question remain unaddressed?" → YES (The kill/not kill question is never answered)

Ground truth: ["yes", "no", "no", "yes"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

From the Prolog file, I found that "Avoiding the Issue" is often confused with:
- **Red Herring**

Let me analyze Red Herring:

**Red Herring**
- Step 1: "Is there more than one argument being presented?" → NO (Only one exchange)
- Step 2: "Are those arguments unrelated or only tangentially related?" → N/A
- Step 3: "Is the introduction of Argument B deliberate rather than accidental?" → N/A
- Step 4: "Is the original argument (Argument A) abandoned or ignored after Argument B is introduced?" → N/A
- Step 5: "Does the person introducing Argument B seem to be trying to divert attention from the original argument A?" → N/A

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes"] - **NO MATCH** (fails at step 1)

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

**Selected Fallacy: Avoiding the Issue**

**Complete Reasoning:**

1. **Perfect Ground Truth Match**: Avoiding the Issue is the only fallacy that perfectly matches all required conditions with a ["yes", "no", "no", "yes"] pattern.

2. **Logical Structure Analysis**: 
   - The judge poses a direct, binary question requiring a yes/no answer
   - Kirk's response about "fighting" is evasive - it's related to the topic but doesn't answer whether he killed the landlord
   - The original question remains completely unaddressed

3. **Distinction from Related Fallacies**: 
   - Unlike Red Herring (which requires multiple distinct arguments), this is a single question-response exchange
   - Kirk isn't introducing an unrelated topic but rather giving an incomplete, evasive response

4. **Real-world Context**: This pattern is common in legal/interrogation contexts where someone avoids directly answering incriminating questions by providing tangentially related but non-responsive information.

**Final Answer: Avoiding the Issue** - Kirk avoids directly answering the judge's binary question about killing his landlord by mentioning he "fought with him," leaving the original question unaddressed.
