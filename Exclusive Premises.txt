I'll perform a comprehensive fallacy analysis following the exact steps specified.

## STEP 1: Initial Fallacy Analysis

Let me analyze this statement against all fallacies in the JSON file. The statement is:
"All forest creatures live in the woods. All leprechauns are forest creatures. Therefore, some leprechauns live in the woods."

After systematically checking each fallacy's steps against the statement, I found one clear match:

**Existential Fallacy:**
- Step 1: "Is the argument a categorical syllogism with two premises and one conclusion?" → YES
- Step 2: "Do both premises use universal qualifiers such as 'all', 'every', 'no', etc.?" → YES (both premises use "All")
- Step 3: "Does the conclusion use a qualifier such as 'some', 'there are', 'there exist', etc.?" → YES ("some leprechauns")
- Step 4: "Does the argument assume that because 'all X are Y', some X must exist?" → YES

Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes"] - **PERFECT MATCH**

## STEP 2: Related Fallacy Discovery and Analysis

Searching the Prolog file for fallacies often confused with Existential Fallacy:

```
often_confused_with(existential_fallacy, negative_conclusion_from_affirmative_premises).
often_confused_with(existential_fallacy, unwarranted_contrast).
often_confused_with(quantifier_shift_fallacy, existential_fallacy).
```

**Related fallacies to analyze:**
1. Negative Conclusion from Affirmative Premises
2. Unwarranted Contrast  
3. Quantifier Shift Fallacy

**Analysis of Related Fallacies:**

**Negative Conclusion from Affirmative Premises:**
- Step 1: Categorical syllogism? → YES
- Step 2: Both premises positive? → YES
- Step 3: Conclusion negative? → NO (conclusion is positive: "some leprechauns live in the woods")
Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes"] - **NO MATCH** (fails step 3)

**Unwarranted Contrast:**
- Step 1: Statement about 'some' members having property? → NO (conclusion mentions "some" but premises are about "all")
- Remaining steps don't apply due to structural mismatch
Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes"] - **NO MATCH**

**Quantifier Shift Fallacy:**
- Step 1: Contains two quantifiers? → YES
- Step 2: Original form 'Every X has related Y'? → NO (premises are about class membership, not relational properties)
- Steps 3-6 don't apply due to structural mismatch
Ground truth: ["yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes", "yes"] - **NO MATCH**

## STEP 3: Final Selection and Comprehensive Reasoning

**Comparison of Results:**
- **Existential Fallacy**: Perfect match (4/4 steps match ground truth)
- **Related fallacies**: No matches found

**Final Selection: Existential Fallacy**

**Comprehensive Reasoning:**

The statement commits the Existential Fallacy because it follows the classic pattern of inferring existential conclusions from universal premises without establishing that the subject class has any members.

The logical structure is:
1. All forest creatures live in the woods (universal premise)
2. All leprechauns are forest creatures (universal premise)  
3. Therefore, some leprechauns live in the woods (existential conclusion)

The fallacy occurs because the conclusion assumes leprechauns actually exist. While the logic would be valid IF leprechauns exist, the premises alone don't establish their existence. The argument illegitimately moves from statements about what would be true of all leprechauns (if any exist) to a claim that some leprechauns actually do exist.

This represents a classic existential import error - treating universal statements as having existential implications when they may not. The perfect match with all four analytical steps and the ground truth pattern confirms this identification with high confidence.
